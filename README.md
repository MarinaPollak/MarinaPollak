# Hi, I'm Marina! 👋🏻


## 🚀 About Me
Marina Pollak is a student of Columbia College majoring in programming. I have a knack for coding and a passion for creating tools that can help make the world around her better. Her portfolio on GitHub showcases her drive and talent to think outside of the box, coming up with creative solutions to difficult problems. Some of the projects I was worked on include an app that simplifies group project management, a visualization tool that helps people understand data more effectively, and an AI chatbot designed to answer common questions quickly and accurately. With a background in coding, Marina also has experience writing code in various languages such as Java, Python, and C++. With my knowledge and enthusiasm for solving complex engineering problems, I hope to continue making meaningful contributions throughout her time at Columbia College.
